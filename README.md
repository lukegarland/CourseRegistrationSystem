# CourseRegistrationSystem
ENSF 409 Term Project - Winter 2020

Dev notes:
 - Set ```CourseRegistrationSystem``` as your Eclipse Workspace.
 - Pre-project exercise, Milestone I, Milestone II and Milestone III will be their own eclipse projects within the workspace.
 - Ensure that you are in the dev branch if you are developing/experimenting with code. Once code is fully tested and correct, create a pull request on github and merge into the master branch.
